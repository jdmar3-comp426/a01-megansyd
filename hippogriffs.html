            What is a Hippogriff?
        </h1>
        <p>
            A hippogriff is a mythical creature in the wizarding world of Harry Potter. Their
            frontside showcases the features of an eagle - talons, a beak, and feathers. Their
            backside has the features of a horse - a long tail, fur, and hooves. Perhaps the most
            exciting feature of Hippogriffs is their pair of wings, which enables them to take
            flight.

            Hippogriff Temperament
        </h2>
        <p>
            Hippogriffs are very proud creatures that you should avoid offending. While it takes
            some time for a Hippogriff to gain the trust of a wizard, they will remain loyal to
            those who earn that trust. However, they are fairly independent creatures who will
            thrive perfectly well on their own.
            If you ever get the opportunity to meet a Hippogriff, its best not to act too excited
            on the outside. Stay calm and wait for the beast to approach you. It is important to
            pay close attention to their body language and retreat if you sense them getting upset.
            A Hippogriff will surely make it very clear whether or not they view you as a friend
            or not.
