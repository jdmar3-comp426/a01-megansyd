            About Hogwarts
        </h6>
        <p style="color:blue;">
            Hogwarts is the school of magic at which the Harry Potter series primarily takes place.
            Located in the Scottish Highlands, Hogwarts is not the only school of its kind. In fact,
            many other schools of magic exist in the world of Harry Potter, however, Hogwarts is
            viewed as one of the finest schools of its kind.

            Who goes to Hogwarts?
        </h6>
        <p>
            As you can probably guess, a school of magic will not enroll students with no magical
            abilities - people known as muggles in the world of Harry Potter. Rather only wizards
            can attend this school of witchcraft and wizardy. Many children grow up with knowledge
            of the school, hoping they will get to go here - students like Ron and his twin brothers
            Fred and George, for instance, were aware of the school long before they stepped foot
            on its grorunds. However, some half-blood or muggle-born children such as Harry only
            learn of the school merely weeks before their first day there.
