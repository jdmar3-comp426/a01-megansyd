        <h4>
            Who is Buckbeak?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Buckbeak is an infamous soul in the wizarding world of Harry Potter. He is a grey Hippogriff with
            a pointed head and vibrant orange eyes. Buckbeak's favorite meal to indulge in involves food so rare it
            seems as though it lost its life only moments ago.

            Buckbeak's Story
        </h5>
        <p>
            Buckbeak makes his iconic appearance in The Prisoner of Azkaban movie, when Harry Potter flies on
            Buckbeak for the first time. Harry and Buckbeak's caretaker, Hagrid, are both quite fond of the
            proud beast. However, later in the movie, Draco Malfoy is up to no good once again! He taunts Buckbeak
            which causes the Hippogriff to injure Draco's arm. This action leads to Buckbeak's execution, as he is
            seen as a threat to the students.
